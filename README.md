- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Deepak Pokkalla
- 👀 I’m interested in applying machine learning to solve challenging problems in computational science and engineering (mechanics, materials, and manufacturing).
- 🌱 I’m currently designing materials/structures and optimizing manufacturing processes using physics-based simulations and machine learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applying state-of-the-art NLP/CV techniques for physics-informed simulations, digital twins, and manufacturing. 
- 📫 How to reach me: mail me at "deepakpokkalla@gmail.com"
